## Overview

This repository contains a library of scripts to ease workflows for digital archiving. Systems used:

- **Archivematica**
- **AtoM**
- **Archive-It**

The scripts help verify file integrity, check technical specifications, evaluate metadata, and streamline the review process for large batches of digitized materials.

## About the Scripts

The tools in this repository are written in **Python 3**.  
Many were developed with assistance from **AI tools (primarily ChatGPT)**, and all scripts have been **extensively tested in a UNIX environment** before being adopted into production workflows.

## Purpose

This library exists to:

- Automate repetitive checks 
- Create logs and manifests to verify successful transfers and document chain of custody
- Standardize validation workflows across asset types  
- Provide transparent, reproducible methods for assessing vendor deliverables  
- Reduce time spent on manual verification

## Usage

Each script includes inline documentation and example usage.  
See the individual script directories for details, dependencies, and instructions.
