## Overview

This repository contains a library of scripts used to perform quality control (QC) on assets digitized by external vendors. Supported asset types include:

- **Video**
- **Audio**
- **Images**
- **Text**

The scripts help verify file integrity, check technical specifications, evaluate metadata, and streamline the review process for large batches of digitized materials.

## About the Scripts

The tools in this repository are written in a mix of **BASH** and **Python 3**.  
Many were developed with assistance from **AI tools (primarily ChatGPT)**, and all scripts have been **extensively tested in a UNIX environment** before being adopted into production workflows.

## Purpose

This library exists to:

- Automate repetitive QC checks  
- Standardize validation workflows across asset types  
- Provide transparent, reproducible methods for assessing vendor deliverables  
- Reduce time spent on manual verification

## Usage

Each script includes inline documentation and example usage.  
See the individual script directories for details, dependencies, and instructions.

## Contributions

While this repository primarily reflects internal workflows, suggestions and improvements are welcome.  
Please open an issue or submit a pull request if you have feedback.
